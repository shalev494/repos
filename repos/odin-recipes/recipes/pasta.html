    <p><strong><h3>Description about the pasta</h3></strong></p>
    <p><h5><strong>This scallop pasta dinner</strong> with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs</p>,<p>but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time.</h5></p>
    <p><strong><h2<em>the recipes for the pasta</em></strong></h2></p>
    <ul>
      <li> 8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti</li>
      <li> 1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
      <li> 1 pound bay scallops </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
      <li>1 pinch red pepper flakes</li>
      <li> 1 cup dry sherry</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped Italian parsley, divided</li>
      <li>Freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <p><h2><strong><em> Steps for make the pasta</em></strong></h2></p>
    <ol> <strong>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes or 1 minute less than directed on the package.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over high heat. When oil just starts to smoke, add scallops and move them into a single layer. Let sear on high for about 1 minute. Toss to turn.</li>
      <li>Add butter and stir scallops until butter melts. Stir in garlic.</li>
      <li>Add lemon zest and red pepper flakes. Stir in sherry and cook and stir until alcohol cooks off, about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Pour in cream. When mixture begins to simmer, reduce heat to medium-low. Add salt, pepper, and lemon juice.</li>
      <li>Drain pasta. Transfer to skillet with scallops; bring to a simmer. Add 1/2 of the chopped parsley. Cook until pasta is heated through and tender, about 1 minute.</li>
      <li>Remove from heat. Garnish generously with grated cheese. Add the rest of the parsley. Serve in warm bowls.</li>
